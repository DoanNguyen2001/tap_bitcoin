# Bitcoin Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict Bitcoin prices using historical market data. The goal is to provide accurate predictions that can aid in understanding market trends and making informed trading decisions. 

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data.
  - Feature engineering to extract meaningful attributes such as daily returns, moving averages, and trading volume changes.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizations of price trends, trading volumes, and volatility.
  - Analysis of market seasonality and correlations.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Supervised models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
  - Time-series models such as ARIMA or LSTM for sequential data.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
  - Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.

- **Deployment**:
  - Predictive models deployed on a web interface for user interaction and live predictions.

## Dataset
The project uses historical Bitcoin data, including:
- **Price**: Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) prices.
- **Volume**: Trading volume in the market.
- **Timestamps**: Date and time of each record.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather historical Bitcoin data from APIs or public datasets.
   - Format data into structured CSV or database format.
   
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Normalize or scale numerical features.
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data entries.
   
3. **EDA**:
   - Visualize trends and correlations in data.
   - Identify key features that influence price movements.
   
4. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create features like moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands.
   - Encode categorical features if present.

5. **Modeling**:
   - Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
   - Select the best-performing model for deployment.
   
6. **Prediction**:
   - Generate price predictions and evaluate their accuracy against actual data.

7. **Deployment**:
   - Create a web interface for live prediction and visualization.
